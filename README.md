# Lab-1
## Debugging and GitHub

This is the first lab for COMP 167 Computer Program Design at North Carolina A&T State University

Instructor: Dr. Kelvin Bryant - ksbryant@ncat.edu

The objective of this lab is to introduce you to git and GitHub, two tools that will be used _extensively_ this semester, as well as the NetBeans IDE.

### What is Git?

Git is a system that allows developers to store multiple _versions_ of a single project, called **branches**. It also allows developers to keep their **local** copy of code up to date with **remote** copies. This has many advantages, mainly that it provides backup copies of code, and makes it easy to _collaborate_ with other developers in the same office, or across the world.

Git stores projects in special directories called **repositories**. A repository is nothing more than a directory, or folder, that has its changes tracked by git. Therefore, most small projects (and every project in this class) should be contained in a single git repository, or folder. You may not know this yet, but you've already created your first git repository! It is called "Lab-1-YOUR-USERNAME" and you're looking at the **remote** copy of this repository _right now_. This remote copy is hosted on GitHub.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a service that hosts remote repositories for millions of developers around the world. Companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, RedHat, Adobe, Twitter, PayPal, and Facebook use GitHub to host their code. GitHub is also the world's largest host of open source projects, making it a treasure trove for young developers to learn from millions of projects.

In this class, we will complete all programming assignments on GitHub, this will allow TA's to easily check your work, and will protect your work from loss should anything happen to your computer.

### Steps for this lab

Now that you know some of the basic terms, lets move into this lab. The first thing you must do is **clone** the repository, or create a **local** copy of the repository on your computer. to do this, you will need to launch the **git bash** app on your lab computer. If you are using your own computer, install git by following the instructions for your operating system on [the git website](www.git-scm.com).
